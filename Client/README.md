# Broadcast-chat-app

A cross-platform desktop app built with Electron.js, Tailwind CSS and React.js. The app allows users to broadcast messages and share images with other devices on the same network in real-time using Socket.io.

• Designed and developed a cross-platform desktop application using Electron.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.
• Implemented real-time communication functionality through Socket.IO web sockets, allowing users to broadcast 
messages to other users on the network.
• Built a robust backend Node.js server with Express.js, CORS, and Socket.IO to handle incoming messages and 
broadcast them to all other users on the network.

## Getting Started

To start the application on a development server:

1. Install the required node modules by running `npm start`.
2. Start the React server by running `npm react:dev`.
3. Start the Electron development server by running `npm electron:dev`.
